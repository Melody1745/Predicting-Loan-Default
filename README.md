# 1. Introduction
In the lending industry, debtors can apply for loans from lenders, and investors can buy the loans from lenders in trade for the promise of compensation with interest. The investors will make income from the interest if the borrower repays the loan. However, failure to repay the loan will cause losses to lenders and investors. Therefore, lenders face the hassle of predicting the threat of a borrower being unable to repay a loan. In this project, the dataset from Lending Club is used to train Machine Learning models to understand the applicant's profile, to decide if the borrower has the ability to repay the loan, and to minimize the risk of future loan defaults. 

# 2. Dataset
The dataset is download from Kaggle, it covers all approved loan information and loan status (whether default or not) from 2007 to the third quarter of 2020.
